In the following we list the links to the datasets we used in this project:

### BIG BASKET DATASET

+ The Big Basket Dataset is a tabular dataset with links to product images. It originates from the catalog of India’s largest online grocery supermarket and includes a variety of categories such as Beauty & Hygiene and Food. The dataset’s features include category, subcategory, product descriptions, price, and product ratings. In total, there are approximately 57,000 products with associated images and 4000 unique brands. Although it lacks fashion products, its features are similar to those in Criteo’s dataset, making it a strong benchmark for evaluating the models.

### FASHION DATASET

+ A significant portion of Criteo's market value comes from the fashion product sector, making it essential to have a dataset dedicated to this category. This dataset focuses exclusively on fashion items, featuring over 100,000 images and approximately 1,000 brands. Each product is classified by category and subcategory, such as clothing and accessories.

### FOOD DATASET

+ The final dataset selected for training the models focuses on food products. This dataset includes images, brand, and bounding boxes outlining the logos. Although it differs more from the previous datasets, the bounding boxes will be particularly useful for training a Convolutional Neural Network specialized in identifying the position of brand logos in images. This approach will be explained in more detail in the next section. The dataset contains approximately 100,000 images and 1,500 unique brands, with some brands having multiple versions of their logo.
